## Dear Agoge Project Family and Friends, 

<br/><br/>

We just want to wish everyone a Happy New year and the best of success in 2022. Covid has impacted us all in many ways personally and professionally. As an organization in 2021 we had many successes and just as many challenges and delays. As many of you who have been following our story know that we were hoping to be open in July of 2021 but with COVID, financial restrictions, and many delays with the development of our new facility at 3203-3205 Belair Road Baltimore MD 21213, we have had to postpone that many times. It is with great joy and excitement that we will soon be announcing our exact start date but we are shooting for early February. This week we passed all of our rough-in inspections, we have a few more weeks of finishing work and final inspections to get through. 

As mentioned above, through the many challenges there were just as many successes in 2021. As an organization we were able to raise $25,000, partner with ABI schools (the Belair Edison Schools and Tunbridge Public Charter) to make sure that we are working together to serve the students who live in our new facilityâ€™s neighborhoods and could benefit from our programming the most, and we partnered with Building for God and Community Foundation to bring the financial support and professional experience that our young organization needs to continue to grow. 

Upon our opening in February we will be providing 30 youth with access to over 1,000 hours of free out of school programming each year. This will include weekly access to academic support, Boxing, Jiu Jitsu, Kickboxing, Strength and Conditioning, Spanish class and long term mentorship. Our youth will also have access to monthly workshops with the goal to add another layer of exposure and life skill development. These workshops will include gardening, nutrition, web design, graphic design, basic building, real estate, finance, multimedia design, photography and more. 


While we are scaling our programming we are still in need of our community's support. If you are interested in supporting financially, sharing your expertise through volunteering, or becoming a mentor please reach out using my contact information below. Starting in March we will also be offering a limited amount of adult memberships to weekly boxing, Jiu Jitsu and Strength and Conditioning classes that will directly supplement our free youth program, please reach out if you are interested in being added to the enrollment list. 

If you are interested in keeping up with us as we move and grow, please stop by our website and sign up for our mailing list and follow us on our social media platforms.

We thank each and everyone of you for your support, and we cannot wait to show you what we have in store this year! 

<br/><br/>

### Until next time, Be Limitless in all that you set out to do.
