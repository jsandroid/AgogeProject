## Dear Agoge Project Family and Friends, 

<br/><br/>
This year has been our biggest year of growth since we started this journey about five years ago. As many of you know, The Agoge Project started in a basement gym, and we have worked each year to build that gym out to its maximum potential. We have worked diligently this year to find a facility and to develop the relationships necessary to help grow our program beyond our wildest dreams. We are excited to announce that in January 2021, we will be bringing The Agoge Project to the 3200 block of Belair Road, in the Belair-Edison neighborhood. 

We have begun fundraising, our target to raise is $50,000. This big fundraising push is coupled with our continued efforts to develop multiple streams of funding for the organization. We anticipate the cost of opening the new facility to be around $25,000 with the remaining $25,000 covering our first years operating expenses. The goal is to have the lease signed within the next week or so and to promptly begin remodeling upon the approval from city permitting. We will be posting updates here to keep everyone updated with the progress along with an anticipated grand opening date. 

Currently our youths receive over 300 hours of free out-of-school programming per year, which includes boxing and MMA training, academic support and monitoring, and a couple of STEM related workshops. At our new facility, our youths will receive over 700 hours of free out-of-school programming a year which will include boxing class, Muay Thai/Kickboxing, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, academic support and monitoring, along with all of the STEM related courses and workshops. All of these [new workshops and courses](/programs) will be facilitated through the 'The Agoge Project Learning Initiative.' Our Learning Initiative will give our students access to a workspace/laboratory where students will get to take courses and workshops in growing fields that will allow them to develop skills, learn how to network, and cultivate their entrepreneurial spirit. The courses and workshops that will be offered will be facilitated by our community partners and Agoge Staff who have the professional expertise in fields such as web design, software engineering/coding, mult-media design, financial literacy, graphic design, apparel design, real estate, gardening, and basic carpentry. 

We look forward to keeping you up to date with our progress and we can't wait to see you at our grand opening. We still need everyoneâ€™s support, so please refer everyone to our website and social media accounts. Also please consider supporting our [Gofundme](https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-agoge-project) or [donate directly to our PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KPCSJHZA6URES&source=url).

### Until next time, Be Limitless in all that you set out to do.
