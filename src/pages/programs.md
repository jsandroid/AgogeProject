### Boxing
Our youth participants are provided with 5, 1.5 hour long boxing sessions per week. The sessions are facilitated by Coach James Chiles who is a former amateur boxer, Army veteran, and current USA boxing amateur coach as well as a seasoned professional coach. The sessions are also facilitated by TAPs President Michael John who is also a current USA boxing amateur coach, professional coach and competed in full contact fighting from the ages of 18 - 28. 

### Brazilian Jiu Jitsu 
Our Youth participants are provided with 6 1.5 hour long jiu jitsu sessions per week. The sessions are facilitated by Dennis Kelley who is a very experienced and knowledgeable purple belt under Mark Gornoll and Dylan Dear Born of Infinite Jiu Jitsu. We are also very fortunate to have another very seasoned grappler Aaron Marhcanti who brings a lot of experience and knowledge to our youth on the mats. 

### Academic Support
There are 5 academic support opportunities for our youth throughout the week. There is a certified teacher on staff during our first hour of programming 5 days a week. Our youth are able to sit to complete their homework in the comfort of knowing that someone is there to support them without any challenges that arise. This helps us as we communicate directly with their teachers at school to develop a plan of support that a student may need to address foundational skill deficits that they are experiencing. 

### Long Term Mentorship 
Our youth are tasked with getting  a binder signed by all of their teachers at the end of each week. They are rated by that teacher on their conduct and academic progress. Each student is then required to spend time on their own that evening completing a personal progress reflection tracker. This document prompts them to reflect on their progress towards their personal and academic goals, the effort that was put into their work that week, and on the areas of success and challenge that they are having. On Saturdays, each participant meets with their mentor (they are paired with a mentor for each quarter of the year) where they go over their binder, debrief the week, and develop a plan for the following week. 
The mission of our long term mentorship program is centered around teaching our youth how to be reflective, set goals, hold themselves accountable with honesty, and build a network/community of people that will support them along the path of self discovery and growth. Our mentors are volunteers from the community who work closely with our organization on a weekly basis and are from vastly  different professional backgrounds. This is done with intention as we are looking to build a community around our kids that is built of people from all walks of life with different experiences and skill sets to share. 

### Spanish Instruction
Our youth participants are provided with two spanish sessions a week and as they develop their spanish speaking skills will have the ability to be promoted into a more advanced class structure. Mr. and Mrs. Seda are both fluent Spanish speakers of Puerto Rican descent and Mr. Seda is a current Baltimore County Public School Spanish Teacher. Many of our students in Baltimore City Public Schools have access to spanish programs or teaching within their school although very few kids show real progress in their learning of the language over time. Our goal is to provide an added resource to this amazing skill outside of school and push the learning of our youth through the Sedaâ€™s interactive teaching methods and engaging classroom culture that they provide. 

### Life Skills Development
Throughout the year we bring in people and organizations to run workshops or a series of experiences for our youth. These sessions can range in topics from personal skill development such as healthy eating, CPR and first aid classes, financial literacy, robotics,  gardening, wood working, etc, to exposure to jobs and skill sets required to work in certain fields. 
Our goal is to start with blanket exposure when it comes to providing our kids with these opportunities. Through our individual interactions with our participants,  mentorship meetings and survey data we identify  kids that have a deeper desire to learn more about the skills that they were exposed to through the workshops. We then leverage our network to try to get them further more individualized or small group based experiences.
